# Data_Box
Application to create data according to user parameters.

The software may be created using Phyton.

The software should be able to create data in 2 different ways:

1) Create a data set according to the parameters defined by the user. The user will be able to define how the data will be created by defining the desired mathematical or statistical behaviour. The user will also be able to define how much data will be created and an output format.

2) Output data in time according to user parameters to be used as input to other software.
